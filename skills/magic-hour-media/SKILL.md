# Magic Hour media

Deliver a usable image, video, or audio result. A queued project ID is an intermediate result unless the user asked only to submit a job.

Requires network access and either a connected Magic Hour MCP server or a Magic Hour API key with an HTTPS-capable runtime. Generation consumes Magic Hour credits.

## Connect to the right service

Use an already-connected Magic Hour creation MCP if available. Its hosted endpoint is `https://mcp.magichour.ai/`. The separate `https://docs.magichour.ai/mcp` searches documentation; it does not generate media.

If creation tools are unavailable, read `references/setup.md` in this skill for setup and the API fallback. Do not silently replace an existing client configuration. Never request an API key in chat or put it in source code; use the client's credential flow or `MAGIC_HOUR_API_KEY` in the local environment.

Use live tool schemas, or the [API documentation index](https://docs.magichour.ai/llms.txt), for current models, allowed durations, resolutions, and prices. Web-app features and plans do not imply identical API support. Do not copy a remembered model catalog or price table.

| Edit an existing image while preserving its content | `ai_image_editor_create_image`          | `wait_for_image_project`       |

Tool names can have a client-specific prefix. Discover their current input schemas before calling them.

## Set the quality target

Before generating, translate the request into a short quality brief:

- intended use, aspect ratio, resolution, and duration
- subject, composition, viewpoint or camera move, lighting, and visual style
- details that must remain accurate, such as identity, product shape, logo, colors, text, clothing, or background
- failure conditions that would make the result unusable

Infer these from the user's project when possible. For a website hero, leave deliberate negative space where the interface places text. When exact identity, product geometry, packaging, or branding matters, prefer editing an authorized reference image over recreating it from text alone. For image-to-video, use the source image to define appearance and prompt mainly for subject motion, camera motion, timing, and what must stay fixed. Keep short videos to one coherent action unless the chosen duration and model support a more complex sequence.

Choose the model from the live schema according to the requested result. Prefer the current recommended model for a general request. When the schema describes a model as better for the needed behavior—such as typography, identity preservation, reference control, motion, audio, or speed—use that evidence to select it. Do not select the cheapest or fastest model when the user prioritizes final quality. When no budget or resolution is specified, use the lowest supported resolution for one output. Confirm the credit cost before choosing a higher-cost resolution or making an additional paid attempt without an established budget. Preserve any resolution, model, and spending limit the user explicitly authorized.

Write a concrete prompt in natural language. Describe the subject and action first, then composition or camera, lighting and materials, style, and required constraints. Avoid conflicting styles, long adjective lists, and unsupported negative-prompt syntax. For edits, state the requested change and the elements that must remain unchanged. Request only missing inputs that materially affect the result. Preserve the user's chosen model and budget.

## Create within the authorized scope

Generation spends credits. Use `account_retrieve` when balance or tier affects feasibility; its result contains private account data, so report only the relevant balance or eligibility. Select supported parameters from the current schema. Prefer one output for an initial asset unless the user requests a batch. An authorized generation does not authorize buying credits, upgrading a plan, or running an unrequested batch.

For face and voice inputs, use material the user is entitled to use and follow the host's applicable safety rules. Do not imply ownership or consent from a public URL alone.

When local input files are needed:

1. Call `video_assets_generate_presigned_url` for their actual media types and extensions.
2. Upload each file's raw bytes to its returned `upload_url` with an HTTPS `PUT` from a runtime that can read the user's file. A successful URL allocation does not upload anything.
3. Verify the upload succeeded, then pass the matching returned `file_path` to the creation tool. Never pass a local filesystem path as a hosted storage path.

The hosted MCP cannot read arbitrary files on the user's computer. If the client cannot upload bytes, use the API/SDK route or ask for an accessible input. Do not invent a hosted local-file upload tool. Existing uploaded paths and stable public URLs returning raw media bytes may also be accepted; consult the current endpoint schema.

Submit the creation request once and retain the returned project ID before doing more work. If the request times out before an ID is returned, do not blindly resubmit: the first request may already have created a paid job. Reconcile it through the user's dashboard or available project evidence first, or explain the uncertainty and obtain direction.

## Complete and deliver

Call the matching wait tool with the existing ID. A polling timeout is not proof that generation failed. If still pending, retrieve or wait for the same project within the user's time budget; do not create another project to recover a wait timeout.

Proceed to download only after the project reports `complete`. On `error` or `canceled`, return the project ID and actionable error; do not claim a usable output. If no download is present, report that proof gap.

Use `exact_download_urls[n]` or `downloads[n].url` exactly as returned. Preserve every signed query parameter; `expires_at` is separate metadata. For an expired URL, retrieve the existing project again before considering regeneration. Never attach the Magic Hour API key to a storage download or presigned upload request.

When the user needs an asset in their application, download it into the requested project location, verify its actual media type and dimensions or duration, and use that local file. Avoid embedding an expiring signed URL into production code.

Preview the finished media whenever the environment supports it. Evaluate it against the quality brief before claiming success:

- images: composition, crop, subject accuracy, anatomy, hands and faces, requested text and logo integrity, unintended lettering or brand-like marks, and visible artifacts
- video: the first and last frames, subject and camera motion, temporal consistency, identity and object preservation, flicker, warping, and unwanted cuts
- lip sync or talking portraits: timing, mouth shapes, face stability, expression, audio continuity, and the requested duration
- audio: intelligibility, pronunciation, pacing, clipping, silence, and audible artifacts

If the result misses a required criterion, identify the specific failure and revise the prompt, input, model, or resolution that caused it. Change the smallest useful variable so the next result is informative. A new generation spends more credits, so iterate only within the user's authorized budget. If no further generation is authorized, return the best result with the failed criterion stated plainly.

Return the finished artifact or usable link, where it was saved, and any material limitation. A tool connection, schema match, or accepted request is not proof of completed generation.
